## 5) IFRS 17 ‚Äî Measurement & Accounting

### 5.1 Contract Grouping & Initial Recognition
- **Group formation:** by portfolio and annual cohort; separate onerous vs non-onerous groups at initial recognition.  
- **Initial measurement:**  
  - Compute **FCF** at initial recognition.  
  - If **FCF < 0** (net outflow): recognize **Loss Component** in P&L.  
  - If **FCF ‚â• 0**: set **CSM = FCF** (unearned profit).

### 5.2 Fulfilment Cash Flows (FCF)
- **Definition (plain language).** Present value of expected future inflows minus outflows **plus** RA for non-financial risk, all within the contract boundary.  
- **Updates.** Reflect current estimates at each reporting date; changes split between **future service** (adjusts CSM) and **past/current service** (P&L/OCI per policy).

### 5.3 Risk Adjustment (RA)
- **Purpose.** Compensation entity requires for bearing non-financial risk.  
- **Methods (examples).** Confidence level or cost-of-capital; disclose methodology, confidence level equivalent, diversification policy.

### 5.4 Contractual Service Margin (CSM) & Coverage Units
- **CSM unlocks.** Adjust CSM for changes in FCF **related to future service**, currency effects (policy), and interest accretion at locked-in rate.  
- **Release.** Recognize CSM to P&L **in proportion to coverage units** (reflecting quantity of benefits and expected coverage period).

### 5.5 Onerous Contracts & Loss Component
- **Recognition.** If expected outflows (including RA) exceed inflows at initial recognition or subsequent measurement for **remaining coverage**, book a loss and create/adjust **LC**.  
- **Tracking.** Present LC movements; utilize before releasing CSM.

### 5.6 Discounting & IFIE (OCI vs P&L)
- **IFRS 17 discounting.** Either **top-down** (derive from asset yields net of adjustments) or **bottom-up** (risk-free plus illiquidity).  
- **Presentation choice.** Disaggregate finance effects; policy option to present some in **OCI** to reduce P&L volatility; disclose policy and impacts.

### 5.7 Reinsurance Held
- **Separation.** Measured as a separate asset/liability; may create a **CSM** for reinsurance held; track gain/loss recognition differences vs underlying.  
- **Timing differences.** Profit/loss patterns may not offset underlying losses contemporaneously.

### 5.8 Transition Approaches
- **Full retrospective** (preferred when feasible).  
- **Modified retrospective** (useful simplifications documented).  
- **Fair value** (requires observable inputs, governance over methodology).

### 5.9 Presentation & Disclosures
- **Balance Sheet:** **LRC** and **LIC** (separate assets/liabilities), reinsurance assets/liabilities.  
- **Statement of Profit or Loss:** insurance revenue, insurance service result (incl. RA release & CSM release), IFIE line(s).  
- **Roll-forwards & reconciliations:** groups/cohorts, CSM, RA, LC; methods, assumptions, sensitivities, and confidence level equivalent for RA.

## 16) Essential Formulas for Agent Decision-Making

### 16.1 IFRS 17 Core Measurement Formulas

#### 16.1.1 Fulfilment Cash Flows (FCF)
**Basic Formula:**
```
FCF = PV(Expected Cash Inflows) - PV(Expected Cash Outflows) + Risk Adjustment
```

**Key Components:**
- **Cash Flows:** Premiums, claims, expenses, reinsurance
- **Discount Rate:** Locked-in rate at contract inception
- **Risk Adjustment:** Compensation for non-financial risk

#### 16.1.2 Contractual Service Margin (CSM)
**Initial CSM:**
```
CSM_initial = max(0, FCF_initial)
```

**CSM Roll-Forward:**
```
CSM(t) = CSM(t-1) + Interest_accretion + New_business + FCF_changes_future_service - Release
```

**CSM Release:**
```
CSM_release(t) = CSM(t-1) √ó (Coverage_Units(t) / Total_Coverage_Units)
```

#### 16.1.3 Risk Adjustment (RA)
**Confidence Level Method:**
```
RA = VaR_Œ±[FCF] - E[FCF]
```
Where Œ± = confidence level (typically 75%, 90%, 95%)

**Cost of Capital Method:**
```
RA = Œ£[SCR_non_hedgeable(t) √ó CoC_rate √ó v(t)]
```
Where CoC_rate = 6% (Solvency II standard)

#### 16.1.4 Insurance Finance Income/Expense (IFIE)
**IFIE from Discounting:**
```
IFIE_discounting = FCF √ó (r_current - r_locked_in)
```

**Presentation Choice:** OCI vs P&L (policy election)

### 16.2 Solvency II Capital Formulas

#### 16.2.1 Technical Provisions
**Best Estimate Liabilities:**
```
BEL = PV(Expected Cash Flows) at risk-free rate
```

**Risk Margin:**
```
Risk_Margin = Œ£[SCR_non_hedgeable(t) √ó 6% √ó v(t)]
```

**Total Technical Provisions:**
```
TP = BEL + Risk_Margin
```

#### 16.2.2 Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)
**Standard Formula:**
```
SCR = ‚àö[Œ£(SCR_i¬≤) + Œ£(œÅ_ij √ó SCR_i √ó SCR_j)]
```

**Key Risk Modules:**
- **Market Risk:** Interest rate, equity, property, spread, currency
- **Life Risk:** Mortality, longevity, disability, lapse, expense
- **Health Risk:** SLT, NSLT, catastrophe
- **Non-Life Risk:** Premium, reserve, catastrophe
- **Operational Risk:** min(30% √ó BSCR, 25% √ó Annual Premium)

#### 16.2.3 Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR)
**Linear Formula:**
```
MCR = max(0.25 √ó SCR, min(0.45 √ó SCR, 0.25 √ó SCR + 0.25 √ó TP + 0.25 √ó Premium))
```

#### 16.2.4 Own Funds & Solvency Ratio
**Solvency Ratio:**
```
Solvency_Ratio = Eligible_Own_Funds / SCR
```

**MCR Coverage:**
```
MCR_Coverage = Eligible_Own_Funds / MCR
```

### 16.3 Reconciliation & Bridge Formulas

#### 16.3.1 IFRS 17 ‚Üî Solvency II Bridge
**Contract Boundary Adjustment:**
```
Boundary_Difference = FCF_ifrs17 - FCF_sii
```

**Discount Rate Difference:**
```
Rate_Difference = PV_ifrs17 - PV_sii
```

**Risk Measure Difference:**
```
Risk_Difference = RA_ifrs17 - Risk_Margin_sii
```

**Total Reconciliation:**
```
Total_Difference = Boundary_Difference + Rate_Difference + Risk_Difference + Other_Adjustments
```

### 16.4 Validation & Control Formulas

#### 16.4.1 Balance Sheet Validation
**IFRS 17 Balance:**
```
LRC + LIC + Reinsurance_assets = Technical_provisions + Reinsurance_liabilities
```

**Solvency II Balance:**
```
Assets = Technical_provisions + Other_liabilities + Own_funds
```

#### 16.4.2 Movement Reconciliation
**CSM Roll-Forward:**
```
CSM_opening + Movements = CSM_closing
```

**Technical Provisions:**
```
TP_opening + Changes = TP_closing
```

### 16.5 Key Ratios & Metrics

#### 16.5.1 IFRS 17 Performance
**Insurance Service Result:**
```
ISR = Insurance_revenue - Insurance_expenses + RA_release + CSM_release
```

**CSM Release Rate:**
```
CSM_release_rate = CSM_released / Total_CSM
```

#### 16.5.2 Solvency II Performance
**Capital Adequacy:**
```
Capital_adequacy = Eligible_own_funds / (SCR + MCR_buffer)
```

**Risk-Adjusted Return:**
```
RAROC = Net_income / Economic_capital
```
