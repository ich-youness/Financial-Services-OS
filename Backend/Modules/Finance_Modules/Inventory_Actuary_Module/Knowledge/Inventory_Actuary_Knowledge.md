**End of Inventory Actuary Module Master Knowledge**

## 24) Embedded Value (EV) & New Business Value (NBV) â€” Reference (Codeâ€‘Free)

**Why this matters.** Some stakeholders ask the Inventory Actuary team for EV/NBV views alongside IFRS 17 / SII metrics. Keep this as an *adjacent* view (not a replacement). Useful for internal value steering and investor-style narratives.

### 24.1 Core Definitions
- **Adjusted Net Asset Value (ANAV):** Available net assets backing the business after adjustments (e.g., for intangible items not considered realisable).
- **Value of Inâ€‘Force (VIF):** Present value of future profits from existing contracts, net of explicit costs of capital and nonâ€‘hedgeable risks.
- **Embedded Value (EV):** `EV = ANAV + VIF`.
- **New Business Value (NBV):** Value created by new business written during the period; often proxied from the new inâ€‘force block.

### 24.2 Simplified Decomposition (reference)
- **PVFP (Present Value of Future Profits)** from existing contracts.
- **Frictional Cost of Required Capital (FCRC)** â€” financing drag on required capital.
- **Cost of Nonâ€‘Hedgeable Risks (CNHR)** â€” explicit deduction for residual risks not hedgeable.
- **Time Value of Options & Guarantees (TVOG)** â€” if products embed financial options/guarantees.
- **VIF (illustrative):** `VIF = PVFP âˆ’ FCRC âˆ’ CNHR âˆ’ TVOG` (granularity by product block).
- **EV:** `EV = ANAV + VIF`.
- **NBV (illustrative):** `NBV â‰ˆ VIF_new_business_block` (ensure separate tracking of acquisition strain).

> Governance: Keep EV/NBV *offâ€‘ledger* and documented as a management view. Disclose method choices, discount curves, and calibration consistency with IFRS 17/SII where applicable.

### 24.3 Inputs & Outputs (for Agents)
- **Inputs:** Contract cashflow projections, required capital path, discount curves, assumptions for lapse/expenses/mortality, option/guarantee parameters.
- **Outputs:** EV, VIF components (PVFP, FCRC, CNHR, TVOG), NBV; sensitivities (rates, lapse, mortality); movement analysis (opening â†’ closing).

### 24.4 Acceptance Criteria
- Reproducible EV/NBV by cohort and product line; reconciliation to opening/closing inâ€‘force and capital.
- Sensitivities published with clear sign/direction; methods disclosed in methodology note.

### 24.5 Typical Pitfalls
- Mixing IFRS 17 RA/SII RM with EV cost layers without reconciling conceptual differences.
- Using inconsistent curves/assumptions vs. reserving/pricing without disclosure.

## 25) IFRS 17 Coverage Units (CU) & Risk Adjustment (RA) â€” Practical Guidance

**Purpose.** Provide crisp selection rules so Agent 5 can align measurement with accounting and disclosure requirements.

### 25.1 Coverage Units â€” selection principles
- **Definition (plain language):** CU reflect the quantity of *insurance coverage* provided in each period.
- **Typical choices (illustrative):**
  - **Nonâ€‘life (shortâ€‘tail):** exposure measures (earned risk coverage), e.g., earned premiums or expected claims coverage.
  - **Life protection:** inâ€‘force sum at risk or expected claims coverage per period.
  - **Annuities:** expected annuity payments (service provided) or number of contracts inâ€‘payment weighted by benefit.
  - **Savings with DP:** service drivers aligned to management of participating fund (disclose rationale).
- **Do/Donâ€™t:**
  - **Do:** Keep CU stable, explainable, and reflective of service pattern.
  - **Donâ€™t:** Use premium cash receipts as CU unless they proxy service; avoid measures dominated by cash timing.

### 25.2 Risk Adjustment for Nonâ€‘Financial Risk (RA)
- **Objective:** Compensation an entity requires for bearing nonâ€‘financial risk (e.g., lapse, mortality, expense, claim variability).
- **Common estimation approaches (document choice):**
  - **Confidence Level:** RA set so fulfilment cashflows have a specified percentile (e.g., 75th).
  - **Costâ€‘ofâ€‘Capital:** RA = sum of (capital for nonâ€‘financial risk Ã— CoC) discounted.
  - **Percentileâ€‘toâ€‘Mean (PTM):** Calibrate distribution, take percentile âˆ’ mean.
- **Disclosures:** Provide method, confidence level equivalence (if not confidenceâ€‘level), drivers of change, and diversification treatment.

### 25.3 Handâ€‘offs to Agents
- **Agent 5:** consumes CU definitions and RA method to build revenue recognition and disclosures.
- **Agent 1/3:** use RA insights to ensure consistency with risk margin style metrics (clearly labelled).

### 25.4 Acceptance Criteria
- CU rationale documented per portfolio; sensitivity where CU alternatives exist.
- RA includes method, parameters, diversification, and reconciliation of movement (opening â†’ closing).

## 26) Reinsurance Treatment â€” Gross/Ceded/Net & Layering

**Objective.** Ensure consistent modelling and reporting for reinsurance held across Agents 1 & 5.

### 26.1 Types & Data
- **Proportional:** Quota Share, Surplus â€” model ceded % and surplus lines; include ceding and profitâ€‘commission rules.
- **Nonâ€‘Proportional:** Excess of Loss (per risk/event/aggregate) â€” model retentions, limits, occurrence vs. aggregate caps, reinstatement premiums.
- **Data Contracts:** store treaties with effective period, counterparty, program (layer), retention/limit, attachment, reinstatement terms.

### 26.2 Calculations (illustrative)
- **Gross â†’ Ceded â†’ Net:** apply treaty logic to cashflows/claims; compute ceded premium, recoveries, reinstatement premiums.
- **Triangles by Layer:** maintain gross and ceded triangles (by LoB and AY/UY); compute IBNR gross, ceded IBNR, and net IBNR.
- **Balance Sheet/PL:** ceded reserves and receivables; impairment testing for reinsurer default (counterparty).

### 26.3 IFRS 17 & SII Notes
- **IFRS 17:** Reinsurance held is measured separately; use consistent but treatyâ€‘specific assumptions; present reinsurance result distinctly.
- **SII:** Consider counterparty default risk (SCR for reinsurance), collateral/credit mitigation and concentration limits.

### 26.4 Acceptance Criteria
- Reconciliation tables show Gross, Ceded, Net for premium, claims, reserves, and recoveries by treaty/layer.
- Tieâ€‘out between Agent 1 reserving outputs and Agent 5 accounting/QRT lines.
