# Risk Model Builder Knowledge Base

## 1. Liquidity Modeling Rules

- Project cash flows under both **normal** and **stressed market conditions**.
- Include **off-balance-sheet commitments** and contingent liabilities in liquidity projections.
- Maintain **minimum liquidity coverage ratios (LCR)** according to regulatory requirements.
- Monitor short-term vs. long-term liquidity gaps and survival horizons.
- Consider currency, jurisdiction, and operational constraints in liquidity planning.

## 2. Interest Rate Risk Modeling Rules

- Measure sensitivity of **Net Interest Income (NII)** and **Economic Value of Equity (EVE)** to interest rate changes.
- Model different interest rate scenarios:
  - **Parallel shifts**
  - **Steepening/flattening curves**
  - **Basis risk**
- Include **embedded product optionalities** such as caps, floors, and prepayment features.
- Ensure compliance with **IRRBB (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) guidelines**.

## 3. Scenario & Stress Testing Rules

- Integrate macroeconomic variables such as:
  - GDP growth
  - Inflation rates
  - Unemployment rates
  - FX, commodity, and equity market shocks
- Include behavioral assumptions (e.g., deposit decay, prepayment rates).
- Ensure scenarios are **plausible, extreme, and regulatory-compliant**.
- Apply **stress testing** to evaluate impact on:
  - Liquidity
  - Capital ratios
  - Profitability metrics

## 4. Reporting & Documentation Rules

- Document all **assumptions, inputs, and methodologies** for each model.
- Use standard metrics for reporting:
  - NII sensitivity
  - EVE sensitivity
  - Liquidity gaps
  - Survival horizons
- Maintain version control and **track updates for model validation**.
- Ensure all models are **auditable and reproducible**.

## 5. General Modeling Best Practices

- Validate models against historical data and benchmark results.
- Maintain a clear **link between models and ALM policy**.
- Incorporate feedback from **risk management, treasury, and finance teams**.
- Ensure models are **flexible** to accommodate new products or regulatory changes.
