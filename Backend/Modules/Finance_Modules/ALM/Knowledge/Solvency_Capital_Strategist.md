# Solvency & Capital Strategist Knowledge Base

## 1. Capital Adequacy Rules

- **CET1 Ratio**: Must remain above **8%** under Basel III requirements.
- **Tier 1 Capital Ratio**: Minimum **10%**.
- **Total Capital Ratio**: Minimum **12%**.
- **Leverage Ratio**: Must be **â‰¥ 3%**.
- **Stress Testing Capital Floors**: Capital ratios must remain above regulatory minimum under adverse scenarios.

## 2. Contingency Funding Rules

- Maintain a **minimum liquidity buffer** equal to X% of short-term liabilities.
- Access **emergency central bank facilities** if funding gap exceeds threshold.
- **Diversify funding sources** to reduce concentration risk:
  - Retail deposits
  - Term deposits
  - Wholesale funding
  - Repo markets
- Predefined **activation triggers**:
  - Short-term liquidity shortfall > 10% of total short-term obligations.
  - Unsecured funding cost exceeds benchmark rate by 50bps.
  - Counterparty exposure concentration exceeds policy limits.

## 3. Balance Sheet Structuring Rules

- **Asset Allocation Limits**:
  - No single asset class > 25% of total assets.
  - Maintain minimum allocation to high-quality liquid assets.
- **Liability Management**:
  - Prefer term deposits over short-term wholesale funding if cost-effective.
  - Align maturities of liabilities to expected cash inflows to minimize liquidity gaps.
- **Regulatory Compliance**:
  - Any balance sheet adjustments must **not reduce CET1 or Tier 1 below regulatory minima**.
- **Capital Efficiency**:
  - Maintain optimal leverage without breaching regulatory thresholds.

## 4. Stress Testing Assumptions

- **Severe Market Shock Scenario**:
  - Parallel +200bps interest rate shift.
  - 10% withdrawal of demand deposits.
  - 20% prepayment on loans.
- **Moderate Stress Scenario**:
  - Parallel +100bps interest rate shift.
  - 5% deposit withdrawal.
  - 10% loan prepayment.
- **Scenario Planning**:
  - Forecast capital ratios and liquidity buffers under multiple macroeconomic shocks.
  - Include behavioral assumptions (deposit decay, prepayment rates, funding roll-off).

## 5. Recommendations & Best Practices

- Maintain **capital buffers above regulatory minimum** to absorb unexpected losses.
- Keep **diversified funding sources** and monitor concentration risk regularly.
- Adjust **asset-liability mix** proactively in response to stress test results.
- Update **stress testing assumptions** regularly to reflect market conditions.
- Document all **contingency funding measures** and triggers for audit and compliance.
