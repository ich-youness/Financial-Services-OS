# Profitability Optimizer Knowledge Base

## 1. Yield Optimization Rules

- Allocate assets to higher-yielding investments **within risk limits**.
- Maintain a **minimum liquidity buffer** of at least 10% of total assets.
- Avoid over-concentration in a single asset class (**> 25% of total assets**).
- Prefer investments with predictable cash flows to align with liquidity needs.
- Rebalance assets regularly to maximize expected return within risk constraints.

## 2. Funding Cost Reduction Rules

- Prioritize low-cost funding instruments:
  - Retail deposits
  - Term deposits
  - Low-interest wholesale funding
- Maintain a **diversified liability structure** to reduce refinancing risk.
- Avoid concentration of short-term funding exceeding 15% of total liabilities.
- Minimize overall funding costs while ensuring sufficient liquidity for obligations.

## 3. ALM Investment Strategy Rules

- Invest surplus liquidity in **low- to medium-risk, short- to medium-term instruments** aligned with ALM policy.
- Ensure investments **comply with regulatory and internal limits**, e.g., maximum exposure per instrument or counterparty.
- Rebalance the investment portfolio regularly to optimize returns while maintaining compliance.
- Consider interest rate and liquidity risk when allocating funds.

## 4. Risk-Adjusted Profitability

- Ensure all investment and funding decisions **remain within defined risk tolerance** (liquidity, credit, interest rate risk).
- Maintain **minimum risk-adjusted return thresholds** for all strategies.
- Avoid strategies that maximize return at the cost of regulatory or liquidity compliance.
- Factor in behavioral assumptions (prepayment rates, deposit decay) when projecting returns.

## 5. Recommendations & Best Practices

- Continuously monitor **asset yields vs. funding costs** to identify profitability improvement opportunities.
- Diversify funding and investment portfolios to reduce concentration risk.
- Reassess ALM policy regularly to ensure alignment with market conditions and regulatory requirements.
- Document all investment and funding decisions for audit and compliance purposes.
