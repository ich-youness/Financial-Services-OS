## Global Aging Trends
- By 2050, 1 in 6 people in the world will be over age 65 (UN, 2022).
- The share of population aged 65+ will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050.
- Median global life expectancy projected to increase by ~6 years (from 73 years in 2022 to 79 years in 2050).

## Longevity & Dependency Ratios
- Old-age dependency ratio (65+ per 100 working-age people 15–64):
  - OECD average: 32 in 2020 → projected 58 in 2050.
  - Japan: 48 → projected 81.
  - EU: 34 → projected 59.
- Rising longevity creates pension gaps and pressure on public systems.

- Employers shifting from **Defined Benefit (DB)** → **Defined Contribution (DC)** schemes.
- Global pension gap (shortfall in retirement savings): estimated $400 trillion by 2050 (World Economic Forum).

## Customer Segmentation Insights
