# Actuarial & Financial Modeling Knowledge Base

## 1. Core Concepts
- **Actuarial Modeling**: Using statistical and mathematical models to estimate risks, costs, and financial reserves.
- **Financial Projections**: Forecasting future premiums, claims, persistency, and solvency requirements.
- **Discounting**: Applying interest rate assumptions to calculate present values of future liabilities and cashflows.
- **Risk Adjustment**: Accounting for uncertainty in cashflows (insurance-specific).

## 2. Key Techniques
- **Claims Frequency & Severity Modeling**:
  - Frequency: Poisson, Negative Binomial distributions.
  - Severity: Lognormal, Pareto distributions.
- **Survival & Persistency Analysis**:
  - Kaplan-Meier estimator.
  - Cox proportional hazards model.
- **Loss Ratio Analysis**:
  - Incurred Loss Ratio = Incurred Claims / Earned Premiums.
  - Loss Development Triangles for reserving.
- **Scenario & Sensitivity Testing**:
  - Stress testing assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest rates.
- **Valuation Methods**:
  - Net Premium Reserve.
  - Gross Premium Reserve.
  - Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL) under Solvency II / IFRS 17.

## 3. Regulatory Guidance
- **IFRS 17**:
  - Contractual Service Margin (CSM) requirements.
  - Separation of insurance components, investment components, and acquisition cashflows.
- **Solvency II**:
  - Risk margin calculation.
  - Own funds and solvency capital requirement (SCR).
- **Local Regulations**:
  - Country-specific reserving bases.
  - Minimum capital requirements.

## 4. Data Sources & Assumptions
- Historical claims & persistency data (CSV).
- Industry benchmarks (OECD, IAIS reports).
- Demographic & mortality tables (UN, WHO, local census).
- Macroeconomic indicators (interest rates, inflation).

## 5. Use Cases
- Pricing validation for new insurance products.
- Reserving and liability adequacy tests.
- Profitability analysis under various scenarios.
- Capital optimization and solvency stress testing.
