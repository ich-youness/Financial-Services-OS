# Consolidation Standards and Procedures

This document provides the accounting and consolidation framework for subsidiaries and group entities.  
It is intended as the knowledge base for consolidation agents.

## 1. General Principles of Consolidation
- Consolidated financial statements present the **group as a single economic entity**.
- Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is obtained and deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
- **Control**: Power over the investee, exposure to variable returns, and ability to use power to affect returns (IFRS 10).

## 2. Data Collection & Integration
- **Subsidiary trial balances** must be submitted in group reporting templates.
- Data must include:
  - Trial balances (local GAAP).
  - Reporting packages with disclosures.
  - Currency information and applicable exchange rates.
- **Conversion rules**:
  - Assets & liabilities: translated at closing rate.
  - Income & expenses: translated at average rate of the period.
  - Equity: historical rates at transaction date.
- **Exchange differences**: recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).

## 3. Mapping & Transformation
