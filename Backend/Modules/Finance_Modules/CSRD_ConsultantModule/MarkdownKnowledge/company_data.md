# CSRD Framework Expert Knowledge Base

## 1. CSRD Overview
- The **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** requires EU companies to report on sustainability issues, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.
- Applies to all large companies and listed SMEs in the EU.
- Focus on **double materiality**: financial impact + impact on society and the environment.

## 2. European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)
- Mandatory reporting standards under CSRD.
- Key ESRS topics:
  - Environmental: Climate change, pollution, water, biodiversity, resource use.
  - Social: Employee matters, diversity, human rights, community engagement.
  - Governance: Business ethics, anti-corruption, supply chain governance.
- Emphasizes **quantitative and qualitative data**.

## 3. Materiality Assessment
- **Double materiality approach**:
  - **Financial materiality:** How sustainability impacts the companyâ€™s financial performance.
  - **Impact materiality:** How company activities affect society and environment.
- Steps for assessment:
  1. Identify ESG topics relevant to the business.
  2. Assess significance on company performance and stakeholder impact.
