# Actuarial Modeling Knowledge Base

## Overview

This knowledge base contains comprehensive information about actuarial modeling methodologies, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. It serves as the foundation for all AI agents in the Actuarial Modeling module, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and compliance across all actuarial activities.

## Core Actuarial Principles

### Fundamental Concepts

#### 1. Time Value of Money

- **Future Value (FV)**: The value of current cash flows at a future date
- **Discount Rate**: The rate used to convert future cash flows to present value
- **Compounding**: The process of earning interest on previously earned interest

**Key Formulas:**
- Present Value: \( PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \)
- Future Value: \( FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \)
- Annuity Present Value: \( PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \)
