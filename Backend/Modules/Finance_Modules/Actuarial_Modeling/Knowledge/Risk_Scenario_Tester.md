# Risk & Scenario Tester Knowledge Base

## 1. Actuarial Risk Assessment Principles
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework
- Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) requirements
- Risk identification, measurement, and aggregation
- Regulatory expectations under Solvency II Pillar II

## 2. Stress Testing
- Market risk shocks: equity, interest rates, inflation, FX
- Demographic shocks: mortality, longevity, lapse rate changes
- Catastrophe and pandemic scenario modeling
- Regulatory stress test guidelines and internal stress scenarios

## 3. Stochastic Modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation for asset and liability distributions
- Scenario generation for interest rates, equities, and economic factors
- Correlation and dependency modeling between risk types
- Simulation of liability cash flows under uncertainty

## 4. Risk Aggregation & Capital Impact
- Aggregating individual risks into overall solvency impact
- SCR (Solvency Capital Requirement) and MCR (Minimum Capital Requirement) under stressed scenarios
- Diversification and correlation effects
- Risk contribution metrics for each line of business or product

## 5. Reporting & Insights
- Interpretation of stress test and stochastic results
- Identifying vulnerabilities and key risk drivers
- Recommendations for capital adequacy and risk mitigation
- ORSA reporting and board-level presentation standards

## 6. Tools & Techniques Overview
- Stress test simulator (market, demographic, catastrophe)
